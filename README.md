# OpenCV Histogram Equalization

Histogram equalization is a basic image processing technique that adjusts the global contrast of an image by updating the image histogramâ€™s pixel intensity distribution. Doing so enables areas of low contrast to obtain higher contrast in the output image.

Essentially, histogram equalization works by:
- Computing a histogram of image pixel intensities
- Evenly spreading out and distributing the most frequent pixel values (i.e., the ones with the largest counts in the histogram)
- Giving a linear trend to the cumulative distribution function (CDF)

The result of applying histogram equalization is an image with higher global contrast.

## How work?
All of data is available in <code>Images</code> folder. After you run the code, all the images in the <code>Images</code> folder will be shown to you and you can select one of
them. like below:
