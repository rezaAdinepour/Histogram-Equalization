# OpenCV Histogram Equalization

Histogram equalization is a basic image processing technique that adjusts the global contrast of an image by updating the image histogramâ€™s pixel intensity distribution. Doing so enables areas of low contrast to obtain higher contrast in the output image.

Essentially, histogram equalization works by:
- Computing a histogram of image pixel intensities
- Evenly spreading out and distributing the most frequent pixel values (i.e., the ones with the largest counts in the histogram)
- Giving a linear trend to the cumulative distribution function (CDF)

The result of applying histogram equalization is an image with higher global contrast.
